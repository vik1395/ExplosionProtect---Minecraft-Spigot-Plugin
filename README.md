This plugin I mainly designed for semi-vanilla servers that would like to protect their players' chests/beds from getting griefed due to a rogue creeper or a player trying to use a TNT/Creeper to prevent him/her self from getting logged by a block logging plugin.

When an explosion is triggered, the plugin checks if a chest or a bed is withing the explosion radius. If it is, then the explosion is cancelled and everything is safe. If it isnt, then BOOM. There are no permissions or a config file for this plugin.
